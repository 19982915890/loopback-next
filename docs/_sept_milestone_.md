## Sept Milestone

_With the core of the framework maturing and contributions shifting to the
LoopBack extensions, we think LoopBack has entered a new stage and it's time to
revisit our approach to planning work, delivering features, fixing bugs, and
improving documentation. See our
[latest blog post](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/2020-community-contribution/)
for more details._
