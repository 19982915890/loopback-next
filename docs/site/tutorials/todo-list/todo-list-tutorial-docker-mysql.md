summary: LoopBack 4 TodoList Application Tutorial - Setting up MySQL in Docker
---

Here are the instructions for getting MySQL running in a docker container for
the purposes of running the TodoList example against a relational database.

### Install Docker

For downloading and installing docker, see
[Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for instructions on how to
install it on your respective operating system.

### Get MySQL docker image

For the purposes of this tutorial, we will use the MySQL 5.7.22 Docker image
since there are less setup steps.

To use MySQL 8.0, please see [Using MySQL 8.0](#using-mysql-8.0). It will
involve several extra steps, however.

```sh
docker pull mysql:5.7.22
```

### List MySQL docker image

To list the Docker image you just downloaded:

```sh
docker images
```

This will output:

```sh
REPOSITORY  TAG     IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
mysql       5.7.22  6bb891430fb6   2 years ago   372MB
```

### Create a docker container based on the image, and set root password and port

We will give the docker container a name of `todo-mysql` and we will give the
`root` user a password of `my-secret-pw`. We will also assign port 3306 of your
machine to port 3306 of the container running MySQL.

```sh
docker run --name todo-mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw  -d mysql:5.7.22
```

outputs a UUID for the container:

```sh
191508fcbcfd3b683fea06bb3c8a2f1f252527a15891b58b124518cf2cb60249
```

If the operating system complains that your 3306 port is already being used on
your machine, you can remove the container, and try a different port number.

```sh
docker rm todo-mysql
docker run --name todo-mysql -p 3307:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d mysql:5.7.22
```

### View the status of your docker container on your machine

```sh
docker ps

OR

docker ps -a
```

The first lists running containers, and the second lists ALL containers (running
and stopped).

If it's up and running, the output should look like this:

```sh
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS                               NAMES
a4a165534aeb        mysql:5.7.22        "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   49 seconds ago      Up 48 seconds       0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp   todo-mysql
```

### View the container logs

To view the logs of the container:

```sh
docker logs todo-mysql
```

You should see output like this:

```sh
MySQL init process done. Ready for start up.

### IP Address and Port of the MySQL Docker container

For Mac and Linux users, the IP address of the docker container running on your
machine will be the IP address of your machine : `127.0.0.1` .

For Windows users, it isn't, and you can find the proper IP address by issuing
the command

```sh
docker-machine ip default
```

You need to know the proper IP address and port values of your MySQL database
when you set the `host` and `port` values in your `db.datasource.ts` file.
[Specifying the datasource properties](./todo-list-tutorial-sqldb.md#specifying-the-datasource-properties).

### Using MySQL 8.0

MySQL 8.0 uses a new authentication method named
[SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.html).

Because the `mysql` Node.js driver
[does not yet support](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql/issues/2002) this form
of authentication, Node.js applications are forced to use the previous
authentication method named
[Native Pluggable Authentication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/native-pluggable-authentication.html).

If you wish to use MySQL 8.0 (or its Docker image mysql/mysql-server:latest) for
the purposes of this TodoList example application, we need to have MySQL 8.0
switch to the `native` authentication method.

In order to accomplish this, we need to delete the root user's definition, and
create the root user again but with a different definition.

{% include note.html content="These are some steps I found in various online forums to quickly get things up and running. Please consult with your database administrator to set this up appropriately for production environments.
" %}

If you already have MySQL 8.0 installed on your machine, you do not need to
perform the docker-related commands, but you will have to perform the
SQL-related commands.

#### Get the latest MySQL docker image

To get the latest Docker image:

```sh
docker pull mysql:latest
```

#### Create a docker container based on the latest image, and set root password and port

We will give the docker container a name of `todo-mysql` and we will give the
`root` user a password of `my-secret-pw`. We will also assign port 3306 of your
machine to port 3306 of the container running MySQL.

```sh
docker run --name todo-mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw  -d mysql:latest
```

#### Switching to Native Authentication

Open up a MySQL interactive prompt into the container

```sh
docker exec -it todo-mysql mysql -uroot -p
```

This opens the `mysql` interactive prompt. You will be prompted for the
password. Enter `my-secret-pw`.

Perform the following commands:

```sh
show databases;
use mysql;
SELECT user,host FROM user;
```

You should see the user `'root'@'localhost'` listed in the results

Continue with the following commands:

```sh
drop user 'root'@'localhost';
CREATE USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'my-secret-pw';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Type `exit` to get out of the interactive shell

Now stop and start the container.

```sh
docker stop todo-mysql
docker start todo-mysql
```

We need to go in again and change one more thing (we are not able to do it in
the same mysql session.)

Open the mysql prompt again:

```sh
docker exec -it todo-mysql mysql -uroot -p
```

You will be prompted for the password. Enter `my-secret-pw`.

Perform the following commands:

```sh
use mysql;
ALTER USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'my-secret-pw';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Type `exit` to get out of the interactive shell

Now stop and start the container.

```sh
docker stop todo-mysql
docker start todo-mysql
```

Check the logs of the container to see if everything is ok.

```sh
docker logs todo-mysql
```

You should see output like this:
